# My-Own-Langage
## WATCH .TXT FOR MORE INFOS
This is my attempt at making my own programming langage using Python. Probably my biggest project yet and also the hardest. I think its a good practice to make me learn about the depths of Python. (also its fun)work in progress 

## no seriously read the txt theres everything in it please please please 


its a fucking nightmare but the lexer, parser, interpreter are done, i handle errors correctly so far, pinpointing line and file.

# content, variables, maths, statement, logical op, comparisons
